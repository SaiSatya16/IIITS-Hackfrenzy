    <h1>Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana)
    </h1>
    <h4>mangosteen, also called purple mangosteen, a handsome tropical tree (family Clusiaceae) is native to Southeast Asia and cultivated for its tart-sweet fruit.
    </h4>
    <p>The mangosteen generally does not prosper outside the tropics and is usually found fresh only in local markets.
    </p>
    <p>Under favourable conditions, the slow-growing mangosteen tree can reach a height of 9.5 metres (31 feet). It has thick, dark green, glossy leaves, 15–25 cm (6–10 inches) long, borne in opposite pairs along the stem, and large rose-pink flowers.</p>
    <p>Seedlings take 8 to 15 years to bear fruit. Individual trees have been reported to yield more than 1,000 fruits in a season, but the plants usually produce good crops only in alternate years.</p>
