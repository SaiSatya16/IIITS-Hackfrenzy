    <h1>Cassava</h1>
    <p>It is a tuberous edible plant of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae) from the American tropics. It is cultivated throughout the tropical world for its tuberous roots, from which cassava flour, breads, tapioca, a laundry starch, and an alcoholic beverage are derived.</p>
    <p>
        Cassava tubers take 9-11 months to ripen. Harvesting signs are yellowing leaves. So once you spot yellowing leaves, cut the stems of the cassava plant down to 8-12 inches; this allows the plant to focus on the tubers and fill them up with starch.
    </p>
    <p>The plant doesnâ€™t mind growing in any one of the three types of soil: loamy soil, clay, or sandy soil.The pH level of the soil can be neutral, slightly acidic, or slightly alkaline.</p>
    <p>Provide the cassava plant with the standard water quota of 1 inch a week. If it rains heavily, though, skip watering until the rainfall ends.
